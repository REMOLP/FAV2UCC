User: "Yeah. But unfortunately from the butt run, it looks like I said this already. But he uses magic to replenish because the butt attack takes magic. Yeah. And also he was using buffs at the end. I guess he needed it. Zero death style. It's fake magic? Okay, good. Is this the boss? No. He's just a big boy. Magic buff. We gotta break the rules. Yeah. We'll see. We'll see if we have to use buffs and stuff. Boss is worse than him. I literally don't remember. I remember this place! That's right! This guy... It's like a three-set Anando! That's right, it's here. I remember. I don't think we can parry him. That range, bro. Take one more hit and we'll bleed him. He doesn't bleed! He doesn't bleed! I forgot he doesn't bleed! Full salon! Full salon! Full salon! That's right! This guy... That's right. Ow, spammer! Spammer spamming!"
