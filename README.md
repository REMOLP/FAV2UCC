# FAV2UCC - the long-awaited successor to the original FAVTUCC project is here!*
*I mean, it will be. Soon.

### Some more info on the actual status of the project right now:
- I keep providing some logs and sample video outputs [here.](https://www.youtube.com/@__Ianr__). Just search for "FAV2UCC" and read some descriptions of these videos.
- there is still a long way to go until the project will satisfy my own needs. But when it finally will, I will upload it here asap, don't worry :)
- speaking of satisfying needs, if possible, I would want to try to make it as friendly as possible, both for devs and end users.

##### Wish me luck...
